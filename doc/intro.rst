Introduction
************

Although the functions in *fplib* are more-or-less abstract, their development originated in the need to solve real problems. Specifically, their development was guided by solving problems in computational proteomics, particularly in the detection of peptides using mass spectrometry. However, as examples from this field would be too domain-specific, their functionality is illustrated on a more general use-cases.
